*Welcome!*

I am currently working on 5G/6G wireless R&D at Samsung Semiconductor, Inc. Prior to joining Samsung, I completed my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) under the guidance of [Prof. Danijela Cabric](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/danijela-cabric/).

My research interests include:
- Machine learning for 5G/6G (PHY layer)
- Multiple antenna techniques: beamforming, massive MIMO, etc.
- Resource allocation and interference management in wireless networks
- Spectrum sensing, dynamic spectrum access, and cognitive radio
- Blind signal classification/identification
- Transmitter localization in wireless networks.

I am also active as a reviewer for many international conferences and journals in the wireless domain.
