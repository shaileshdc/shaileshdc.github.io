I am a fourth year PhD candidate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. I am part of the [WiTech](https://www.witechlab.com/) Lab working under the guidance of [Professor Swarun Kumar](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/swarunk/) and [Professor Osman Yagan](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/oyagan/). My work broadly falls in the category of Wireless Systems with projects spanning form Rethinking Satellite Ground Station design to mmWave Full Duplex Communication and Sensing systems. My current work focusses on making satellite ground station infrastructure more accessible to the public by reducing the its size, cost and complexity. In my projects, I have shown how these tiny ground stations can collaboratively receive satellite signals that can be used for senssing applications at a fraction of the cost and space needed for traditional ground stations. Please check out my [publications page](https://vaibhavsingh.github.io//publications/) to learn more about my work.

Before coming to CMU, I completed my B.Tech(Honors) and M.Tech in Electrical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Madras under the Dual Degree program. For my M.Tech thesis, I worked under [Professor David Koilpillai](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~koilpillai/academic.php) on improving the BER for MIMO Time Reversal Systems.
