I am a fourth year PhD student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. I work in the field of wireless communication systems at [WiTech](https://www.witechlab.com/) Lab under the guidance of [Professor Swarun Kumar](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/swarunk/) and [Professor Osman Yagan](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/oyagan/).

Before coming to CMU, I completed my B.Tech(Honors) and M.Tech in Electrical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Madras under the Dual Degree program. For my M.Tech thesis, I worked under [Professor David Koilpillai](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~koilpillai/academic.php) on improving the BER for MIMO Time Reversal Systems.
